# Personal blog of David Aaron Pierce

Running live at [https://davidaaronpierce.com](https://davidaaronpierce.com).

I used [eleventy-high-performance-blog](https://github.com/google/eleventy-high-performance-blog) as a basis. It has a lot of web performance best-practices built-in, ontop which I modified it to suit my own styling and removed all the original's Google Analytics stuff for a tracking-free user experience.

Technologies used:

- [Eleventy static site generator](https://www.11ty.dev/)
